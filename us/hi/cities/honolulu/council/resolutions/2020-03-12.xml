    <search-text>CITY COUNCIL CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU No. 20-75 HONOLULU, HAWAII RESOLUTION URGING THE CITY ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE HAND SOAP DISPENSERS, PAPER TOWELS, AND TOILET PAPER IN ALL PUBLIC RESTROOMS IN CITY FACILITIES, INCLUDING ALL COMFORT STATIONS IN CITY PARKS. WHEREAS, the City and County of Honolulu ("City") maintains and services dozens of public restrooms in City facilities such as Honolulu Hale, the Fasi Municipal Building, Kapolei Hale, Kapalama Hale, and the Honolulu Police Department Headquarters, and also maintains and services 214 comfort stations in 299 park properties; and WHEREAS, in 2019 the City Council ("Council") appropriated $494,000 to the Department of Parks and Recreation's Recreation Services Division and the Grounds Maintenance Division for cleaning and toilet supplies for the fiscal year 2020 to buy hand soap, paper towels, and toilet paper for comfort stations in City parks; and WHEREAS, the Council also appropriated $349,249 to the Department of Facility Maintenance's Public Building and Electrical Maintenance Division for cleaning and toilet supplies to buy hand soap, paper towels, toilet paper, and disinfectant for public restrooms in City facilities serviced by in-house custodial personnel; and WHEREAS, in spite of these appropriations, the reported lack of soap and other necessities in comfort stations and public restrooms has long been a problem, so much so that one prominent mayoral candidate in 2012 promised that if elected he would make his first task to equip all of the City's restrooms with soap; and WHEREAS, in 2012 a former Director of Parks and Recreation noted that the reason for the lack of soap, paper towels, and toilet paper in park restrooms was because many parks are unattended due to a lack of groundskeepers, as well as the theft of supplies and the vandalism of dispensers and other equipment; and WHEREAS, San Francisco uses mobile bathrooms in its notorious "Tenderloin District," guarded by attendants who make sure the portable toilets stay sanitary and keep them stocked with toilet paper, soap, paper towels, and toilet seat covers; and WHEREAS, San Francisco also plans, if funding is available, to assign attendants to permanent public bathrooms that have become nearly unusable; and WHEREAS, in 2015 Honolulu opened attendant-monitored public bathrooms in Chinatown's Pauahi Hale, which provides public toilets and showers seven days a OCS2020-0308/3/1 1/2020 3:52 PM 1 CITY COUNCIL CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU HONOLULU, HAWAII No. 20-75 RESOLUTION week, with a nonprofit service provider handing out toiletries and towels for users who have 10 minutes to freshen up; and WHEREAS, the bathrooms were built to handle heavy use and there has been no reported vandalism, graffiti, or damage, with an added benefit of a reduction of public urination and defecation in the area; and WHEREAS, the Council finds that providing basic sanitary supplies in public restrooms in all City facilities, including comfort stations in all city parks, is critical in light of the recent coronavirus outbreak, as washing one's hands with soap is one of the most effective means of slowing the spread of infectious disease, and hand towels permit patrons to dry their hands and exit restrooms without touching potentially unsanitary surfaces; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Council of the City and County of Honolulu that it urges the City Administration to provide and maintain hand soap dispensers, paper towels, and toilet paper in all public restrooms in City facilities, including all comfort stations in City parks; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Council urges the Administration to consider implementing a pilot program with attendant-monitored comfort stations in select parks, as well as in select public restrooms in buildings and facilities, to address problems with theft, vandalism, and damage; and OCS2020-0308/3/1 1/2020 3:52 PM 2 CITY COUNCIL CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU HONOLULU, HAWAII No. 20-75 RESOLUTION BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be transmitted to the Mayor, the Managing Director, the Director of Parks and Recreation, and the Chief Engineer of the Department of Facility Maintenance.
