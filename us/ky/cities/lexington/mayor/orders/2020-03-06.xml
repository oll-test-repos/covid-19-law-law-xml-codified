    <search-text>Executive Order No. 2020 - 01 An Executive Order Declaration of State of Emergency Whereas, On January 31, 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), beginning January 27, 2020; and Whereas, COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can result in serious illness or death, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is a new strain of coronavirus that had not been previously identified in humans and can easily spread from person to person; and Whereas, On March 6, 2020, a case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Lexington-Fayette County, Commonwealth of Kentucky; and Whereas, On March 6, 2020, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, declared a state of emergency in the Commonwealth of Kentucky due to the confirmed case of COVID-19; and Whereas, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies the potential public health threat posed by COVID -19 both globally and in the United States as "high", and has advised that person-to person spread of COVID-19 will continue to occur globally, including within the United States; and Whereas, The planning and preparedness of state and local agencies for a COVID-19 public health emergency in Lexington-Fayette County is a concern to all our citizens; and Whereas, occurrence of a confirmed case of COVID-19 is of such severity or complexity as to require the exercise of extraordinary emergency measures; and Whereas, The Lexington-Fayette County Health Department has specially trained personnel and resources to assist the state and local authorities in the protection of life, public health and safety, through coordinating a response to this emergency; and Whereas, It is both appropriate and desirable to coordinate with federal, state and local agencies to attain the maximum effective response to the circumstances described herein; Now, therefore, I, Linda Gorton, Mayor of the City of Lexington, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Chapter 39A of the Kentucky Revised Statutes, declare that a State of Emergency exists in Lexington-Fayette County, and that I shall be exercising the authority granted to me through the issuance of Executive Orders and through the use and direction of City personnel, services and equipment and additional acts necessary to the management of this emergency. Subject to any orders of Governor Andy Beshear, I do hereby order and direct all divisions and departments of the Lexington-Fayette County Government to coordinate and cooperate with the Lexington-Fayette County Health Department, the Commonwealth of Kentucky and any federal agencies to respond to the public health threat posed by COVID-19 by exercising the powers described in KRS Chapter 39A and to provide information to individuals, businesses, organizations and other entities regarding how they can best prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 State of Emergency declared herein. This Declaration of State of Emergency shall remain in effect until terminated by the issuance of another Executive Order when I determine that a state of emergency no longer exists and the exercise of extraordinary measures are no longer required for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Signed this, the 6" day of March, 2020 MAYOR Linda Garten</search-text>
